# Project--Wine_Quality_Analysis

Used Python and Machine Learning module to predict Wine Quality.

For this project, I used provided Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. 
Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is 
either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7).

The objectives of this project are as follows:
1) To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
2) To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine
